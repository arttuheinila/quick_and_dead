# quick_and_dead
Physical training randomizer in the way of Pavel Tsatsouline's Quick And Dead -protocol.

You could do the randomizing with real dice, but since I so often don't have them at hand when getting ready to train OR I forget the order and numbers. That's why this.

No required packages (other than python)
